A Vim plugin for automatically saving backup versions in RCS whenever a file is saved.  You can compare to any revision as well.
keywords: VCS, version control system, incremental saving, automatic versioning, automatic journalling or journaling, or autosave backups with versions.

The maintainer is Juan Frias (juandfrias at gmail.com)

What's RCS? It's the Revision Control System, a set of programs used for keeping many versions of a file. See http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/rcs.html

The RCS programs are freely available at http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/trinkle/RCS/

Be careful if you really use RCS as your production file control, it will add versions like crazy.  See the g:rvMode option to have more control over when a save is added to the revision file.

rcs-menu.vim by Jeff Lanzarotta is handy to have along with this (vimscript #41).

Inspired by savevers.vim by Ed Ralston (vimscript #89).

 Mapped Keys: 
               <Leader>rlog    To access the saved revisions log.  This works as
                                      a toggle to quit the revision windows too.

               <enter>         This will compare the current file to the
                                    revision under the cursor (works only in
                                    the revision log window)

               <Leader>older   does a diff with the previous version

               <Leader>newer   does a diff with the next version

 You probably want to map these in your _vimrc to something easier to type, 
 like a function key.  Do it like this:
"re-map rcsvers.vim keys
map <F8> \rlog
map <F5> \older
map <F6> \newer

 You may need to set the following shell(environment) variables, you'll get a warning if so:
 user name:
		LOGNAME=myusername
 timezone:  
		TZ=EST5EDT
